  "name": "The Black Anchor - Guild Board Alcove",
  "description": "This quieter alcove has been reinforced with iron brackets and thick planks. A large notice board dominates the far wall, covered in contracts, bounties, and expedition postings. Wax-sealed letters and official notices suggest interest from nobles, merchants, and distant powers. A narrow desk sits nearby where guild business is recorded, its ink stained by constant use.",
