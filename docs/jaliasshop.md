## Conversation Keywords & Responses

### [goods]

> “Basic supplies. Nothing fancy, nothing cursed. Weapons that won’t snap, armor that won’t rot, and tools that still work after a week in the Unflooded Sea.”

(Unlocks shop interface)

---

### [prices]

> “Prices are fair. They get better if people speak well of you. Worse if they don’t. Reputation travels faster than ships around here.”

---

### [new cove]

> “New Cove’s young, fragile, and trying not to die. We build fast, repair faster, and hope the sea floor stays quiet.”

---

### [unflooded sea]

> “Raised ocean floor. Coral where trees should be. Kelp where roads should be. Plenty of things out there that chew through bad gear. Stock up before you wander.”

---

### [magitium]

> “The Magitium Consortium? They sell answers wrapped in spells. Useful, sure — but they don’t give credit. I do.”

---

### [repairs]

> “I don’t forge miracles, but I can patch dents, tighten straps, and keep your gear alive a bit longer.”

(Enables basic **Repairing** services)

---

### [rumors]
