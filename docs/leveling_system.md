# Leveling System

Levels represent a character’s overall growth and capability. Progression is designed for a long-form MUD experience.

---

## Level Range & Tiers

Levels run from **1–20**.

- **Low Tier:** 1–5
    
- **Mid Tier:** 6–10
    
- **High Tier:** 11–15
    
- **Epic Tier:** 16–20
    

---

## Progression Goals

- Expected time to reach **Level 20**: **~6 months** of regular play
    
- Progression should feel steady at low levels and increasingly meaningful at higher tiers

## How You Gain Experience

You gain **Experience (EXP)** from:

- **Defeating creatures**
    
- **Completing tasks / quests**
    
- **Exploration** (discovering new rooms/regions, landmarks, secrets)
    

EXP is awarded as a mix of:

- Immediate gains (kills, room discovery)
    
- Completion gains (tasks/quests milestones)

## Level-Up Rewards

### Attribute Gains

- **Every 3 levels**, you gain **+1 Attribute Point** to allocate.
    

Levels that grant an Attribute Point:

- **3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18**
    

### Maneuver Gains

- **Every 5 levels**, you gain **one maneuver** that **does NOT** have the **Learned** trait.
    
    - _Learned_ means the maneuver must be taught by a master.
        
    - Non-Learned maneuvers represent instinctive growth, personal breakthroughs, or universal training.
        

Levels that grant a Non-Learned Maneuver:

- **5, 10, 15, 20**
    

---

## Maneuver Teaching Rules (Reminder)

- Most maneuvers have the **Learned** trait and must be acquired through:
    
    - Finding masters
        
    - Meeting skill + level prerequisites
        
    - Sometimes faction/reputation requirements
        

Non-Learned maneuver gains are the exception and happen only at the level milestones above.

## Design Notes

- Level is a **capability gate**, not the primary build lever
    
- Skills (1–100) remain the main driver of mastery
    
- Milestone rewards (every 3 / every 5) create predictable, satisfying progression beats
    
- Tier transitions (6, 11, 16) should unlock new regions, masters, and threats
