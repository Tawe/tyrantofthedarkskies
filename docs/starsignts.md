# Star Signs

Star Signs represent **fate at birth**. A character’s Star Sign is determined by their **in‑game birth date** during character creation.

Star Signs are:

- Permanent
    
- Always active
    
- Lighter in impact than **Species** and **Planets**
    
- Focused on fate, temperament, and narrative flavor
    

Each Star Sign provides:

- **+2 to one attribute**
    
- **-1 to one attribute**
    
- A small **Fated Mark** (situational, low‑impact)
