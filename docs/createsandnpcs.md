# NPC & Creature Design System

NPCs and Creatures follow the **same core rules as Player Characters**. They possess attributes, skills, maneuvers, equipment, and progression within tiers. What differentiates them from PCs is **role, scope, persistence, and rewards**.

This document defines how NPCs and Creatures are structured, categorized, and used in play.

---

## Shared Foundation (PC Parity)

All NPCs and Creatures have:

- Attributes (Physical, Mental, Spiritual, Social)
    
- Skills (1–100, trained + usage growth)
    
- Maneuvers (Learned and non-Learned)
    
- Equipment (weapons, armor, tools)
    
- Hit Points, stamina, and other derived stats
    
- Outlook values using the **NPC & Faction View Matrix**
    

They resolve actions using the **same unified mechanics** as players.

## Key Differences from Player Characters

NPCs and Creatures differ from PCs in the following ways:

- **Assigned Combat Role** (defines behavior and stat bias)
    
- **Fixed Tier** (do not freely level like PCs)
    
- **EXP Value** (granted when defeated)
    
- **Loot Tables** instead of inventories
    
- **Narrative Persistence** (many are disposable)
    

---

## Combat Roles

Each NPC or Creature is assigned **one role** within its tier. Roles define tactical behavior, stat emphasis, and encounter purpose.

### Brute

**Concept:** Frontline martial combatant

- High Physical
    
- Second-highest HP pool
    
- Focus on direct damage and threat
    
- Limited mobility or utility
    

**Typical Maneuvers:**

- Heavy strikes
    
- Charges
    
- Area pressure
    

---

### Minion

**Concept:** Disposable support and battlefield clutter

- Very low HP (1–2 hits)
    
- Simplified stats
    
- Limited or single maneuver
    
- Often deployed in groups
    

**Design Rule:**

- Threat comes from numbers, not durability
    

---

### Boss

**Concept:** Area-defining adversary

- Highest HP pool
    
- Multiple maneuvers across roles
    
- Unique mechanics or phases
    
- Often tied to narrative progression
    

**Design Rule:**

- Bosses should break or bend rules
    

---

### Artillery

**Concept:** Ranged damage specialist

- Focus on ranged weapons or magic
    
- High accuracy, lower HP
    
- Relies on positioning and protection
    

**Typical Maneuvers:**

- Precision attacks
    
- Area denial
    
- Long-range pressure
    

---

### Healer

**Concept:** Sustain and recovery support

- Avoids frontline combat
    
- Moderate defenses
    

**Typical Maneuvers:**

- Direct heals
    
- Regeneration
    
- Cleansing effects
    

---

### Controller

**Concept:** Battlefield manipulation

- Uses maneuvers to restrict movement or actions
    
- Lower damage output
    
- High Mental or Spiritual
    

**Typical Maneuvers:**

- Immobilization
    
- Disruption
    
- Forced positioning

## Role-Based Stat Bias (Guidelines)

|Role|HP|Damage|Control|Support|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Minion|Very Low|Low|Low|None|
|Artillery|Low|High|Medium|Low|
|Brute|High|High|Low|None|
|Healer|Medium|Low|Low|High|
|Controller|Medium|Low|High|Medium|
|Boss|Very High|High|High|Medium|

## Tier Scaling

NPCs and Creatures are assigned a tier:

- **Low Tier:** 1–5
    
- **Mid Tier:** 6–10
    
- **High Tier:** 11–15
    
- **Epic Tier:** 16–20
    

Tier determines:

- Attribute ranges
    
- Skill caps
    
- Maneuver access
    
- EXP value
    

NPCs do not normally advance tiers unless altered by narrative events.

---

## EXP Values

Each NPC/Creature has a fixed **EXP value**.

Guidelines:

- Minions: Low EXP, balanced by numbers
    
- Standard NPCs: Baseline EXP
    
- Bosses: Large EXP rewards
    

EXP is awarded **only on defeat**, not on repeated farming of trivial enemies.

---

## Equipment & Loot

### Equipment

NPCs use equipment normally during combat.

- Equipment may break or be damaged
    
- Not all equipment drops on death
    

### Loot

Loot is generated from **tier-appropriate loot tables**.

- Rolled on defeat
    
- May include:
    
    - Materials
        
    - Currency
        
    - Consumables
        
    - Rare items
        

Bosses often have guaranteed or unique loot.

---

## Outlooks & Relationships

NPCs and Creatures maintain **outlooks** toward:

- Individual players
    
- Factions
    

Outlooks use the **NPC & Faction View Matrix**:

- Hostile creatures may still favor certain factions
    
- Neutral creatures may react differently based on player actions
    

Outlooks influence:

- Aggression
    
- Cooperation
    
- Dialogue (where applicable)
    
- Target selection in combat
    

---

## Design Intent

- Maintain mechanical consistency across the world
    
- Allow enemies to feel fair and understandable
    
- Support emergent encounters and mixed-role groups
    
- Make the world reactive, not scripted
    

NPCs and Creatures are not obstacles — they are participants in the world.
