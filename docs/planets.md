# Planetary Influences

At character creation, each character is born under the influence of a **Planet**. Planets represent cosmic guardianship and destiny rather than belief (which is handled by Religion).

Each Planet:

- Grants **one starting maneuver**
    
- Provides a **passive effect** that scales by tier
    
- Shapes the character’s style of play from level 1 onward
    

Planets are permanent and cannot be changed.

## Design Notes

- Power scales horizontally, not just numerically
    
- Planetary abilities synergize with skills and maneuvers
    
- Epic tier effects bend rules without invalidating others
